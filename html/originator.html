	<h3>What made you think you could become an author?</h3>
	<p>The question displeases me.  Rephrase it or give me another one.</p>
	<h3>Why create anything?</h3>
	<p>I had a troubled childhood--bedwetting, animal mutilation, pyrophilic incidents, you know, and art gave me a way to express my inner anguish without risking punishment.  I've learned to comply better with social requirements as an adult, but, you know, that stuff just gets bottled up, I have whole kegs of urine piled in the cellar of my soul, and smoldering carcasses of mutilated animals--it's all still there.  Has to come out somehow.
	</p>
	<h3>What crimes would you say have inspired you the most?</h3>
	<p>Oh gosh, the Holocaust, but I guess that goes without saying.  The work of Holmes, Fish, the Cleveland Butcher, Bundy, Kemper, BTK, Dahmer, but that's again pretty obvious.  Interesting single kills: the work of Sagawa, Claux, Meiwes.  I trying to dig deeper here. Israel Keyes, a really principled serial killer, made a big impression on me, if we're talk about more recent stuff.    
    <h3>Great.  Next question: any literary influences?</h3>
	<p>I'm an avaricious reader, and I have dipped into many great works, for sure.  The works of Mark Sade, though, stand out.  I've read them all.</p>
	<h3>Do you mean the Marquis de Sade?</h3>
    <p>Perhaps.  But I meant the English versions, of course</p>
    <h3>Oh, which is your favorite?</h3>
    <p>I don't know.  They're all so good.  Also, I would like to pay homage to Shakespeare and Joyce and Nabokov, some of my closest friends, in a manner of speaking</p>
    <h3>Let's talk a little bit about the books.  A lot of people I've spoken to see the ostrich as a symbol of totalitarian bureaucracy that excuses any and every atrocity bureaucrats may commit, going back to Arendt's idea of the banality of evil? What do you say to that?</h3>
	<p>You know what it is, for the me the ostrich is freedom, pure and simple, and sure, that might be the kind of freedom a bureaucrat or secret police officer enjoys under a totalitarian regime, it might be the freedom an artist enjoys in a democracy.  Freedom to just wreck everything and laugh in people's faces, that's what the ostrich is about.  That's what I want to celebrate.</p>
